***P**hylogenetic **A**ncestral **R**econstruction of **A**natomy by **M**apping **O**ntologies*

The $PARAMO$ pipeline requires three initial pieces of data: a character matrix, a dated phylogeny, and an anatomy ontology. Herein, we use a set of 19 characters from Ontotrace and a large-scale phylogeny of fishes from  [@rabosky2018]. In this demonstration, we are interested in constructing the amalgamated characters for the three levels of amalgamation (=anatomical hierarchy): anatomical dependencies (ADs), body regions (BRs) and entire phenotype (EF). At the BR level, three main body types are considered -- "dermatocranium", "paired fins" and "external integument structures". 

# STEP 1. Initial character matrix

We are going to retrieve our dataset from the Phenoscape Knowledgebase for demonstration purposes as our starting point. We are then going to reconstruct the history of these traits accounting for dependencies among them and amalgamating them according to trait type using the UBERON Anatomy Ontology. 

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Define our traits
terms <- c("dermatocranium", "paired fin", "barbel") 
# Define our taxon
taxon <- "Siluriformes"   

# Apply pk_get_ontotrace_xml over all our traits in our taxon of interest, the Siluriformes. We specify
# variable_only=FALSE to return invariant characters.
nex <- lapply(terms, pk_get_ontotrace_xml, taxon=taxon, variable_only=TRUE)
names(nex) <- terms

.m <- lapply(nex, pk_get_ontotrace)
# Merge together the resulting 3 matrices and remove non-trait data and duplicated columns
m <- reduce(.m, full_join, by="taxa", suffix=c("", ".y"))  
m <- select_at(m, dplyr::vars(-contains("otu"))) # Removes otu data
siluriformes <- select_at(m, vars(-contains(".y"))) # Removes duplicated columns
print_coverage(siluriformes)
```

To save time, simply run the line below rather than the chunk above.

```{r}
data(siluriformes)
print_coverage(siluriformes)
```


The table that prints out shows the number of taxa for which there is data in the KB ( _coverage_ ) and the proportion of taxa ( _average_ ) that have this trait (all of these are binary, presence/absence characters). This dataset is too big for our demonstration purposes. So lets filter down to a smaller set of traits that will illustrate our process. 

```{r}
dat <- dplyr::select(siluriformes,"taxa", 
              "vomer", "accessory vomerine tooth plate",
              "mental barbel", "inner mental barbel", "outer mental barbel", "anterior nasal barbel", "posterior nasal barbel", "maxillary barbel",
              "urohyal", "urohyal lateral process", "urohyal median process", 
              "pectoral fin spine", "anterior dentation of pectoral fin spine", "posterior dentation of pectoral fin spine", 
              "pectoral fin",
              "pelvic fin", "pelvic splint", "pelvic fin ray"
              )

## Let's also clean up some of the species names to only include Genus and species
dat$taxa <- unname(sapply(dat$taxa, function(x) paste(strsplit(x, split=" ")[[1]][1:2], collapse="_")))

dat
```

Now let's load in the Rabosky fish phylogeny and match it to the data using `treeplyr`.

```{r}
data(fishtree)
td <- make.treedata(fishtree, dat)
td
```

We we want to learn about these traits, so we're going to build a nice data table to see what these traits are and their unique identifiers using the KB API and `rphenoscape` function `pk_anatomical_detail`. 

```{r}
traits <- colnames(td$dat)
anatomical_details <- lapply(traits, pk_anatomical_detail) # Query over traits and get anatomical details 

char_info <- list()
char_info$ID <- traits
char_info$char_statement <- sapply(anatomical_details, function(x) x$definition) # Extract definitions
char_info$STATE_0 <- rep(0, length(traits)) # All ontotrace matrices are binary presence/absence
char_info$STATE_1 <- rep(1, length(traits)) # All ontotrace matrices are binary presence/absence
char_info$IRI <- sapply(anatomical_details, function(x) x$id) # Extra a unique URL identifier called an "IRI" 
char_info$IRI <- gsub("http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/", "", char_info$IRI)
char_info$IRI <- gsub("_", ":", char_info$IRI)

char_info <- data.frame(char_info)
as_tibble(char_info)

```

```{r}
njt <- makeTraitTree(td, skip=NULL)
njt <- root(multi2di(njt), grep("barbel", njt$tip.label))
ontologyHeatMap(td, njt, start=1, cex=0.25)
```

Some of our taxa are really data poor, so let's filter them out and deal with a smaller, more manageable dataset by excluding all taxa that don't have at least 50% of the traits as data.

```{r}
tdf <- filter_coverage(td, traits=0, taxa=0.5)
njt <- makeTraitTree(tdf, skip=NULL)
njt <- root(njt, grep("barbel", njt$tip.label))
ontologyHeatMap(tdf, njt, start=1, cex=0.25)
```

Next, we want to identify the dependencies in our traits by using `rphenoscape::pa_dep_matrix`, which returns a presence-absence dependency matrix when provided a list of terms. In other words,
it returns which traits depend on the presence of another trait. This will be key information for building our evolutionary models, as not considering it can result in impossible ancestral state
reconstructions and can also help the pseudoreplication that occurs when considering non-independent characters in phylogenetic analyses.

```{r}
dep.mat <- pa_dep_matrix(gsub("N:", "N_", paste0("http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/", char_info$IRI, sep="")), .names="label", preserveOrder=TRUE)
diag(dep.mat) <- NA
G1 <- graph_from_adjacency_matrix(t(as.matrix(dep.mat)))

con.comp=components(G1, "weak") # Organizes the subgraphs within our graph and allows us to pick out connected pieces


plot(G1, vertex.size=5, edge.arrow.size=0.5, vertex.label.cex=0.75)

plot(induced_subgraph(G1, which(con.comp$membership==8)), vertex.label.cex=0.75)
```


Now we can build in our dependencies into our evolutionary models. We are going to do this manually for this workshop. We have tools that extract these from graphs, but it's less obvious what's happening, and these are not robust yet. This is a major part of our project, to build tools that will construct these models in an automated fashion.

```{r}
## Right now this is done manually, we are working on making it work for the graphs we created above, but lets do it one by one for each module. 
M <- list() # Stores our matrices

## Now let's consider mental barbels. We can see from the graph that outer and inner mental barbels depend on a mental barbel being present. We need to amalgamate
## these into a single, multistate character. 

G.mental.barbel <- induced_subgraph(G1, which(con.comp$membership==3))
bin_mats <- init_binary_matrix(G.mental.barbel) # Start with independent models for each trait
gtraits <- names(bin_mats) # Pull out the names of the traits we're working with
newTraitName <- paste(gtraits, collapse="+") # Define the trait name of our new, amalgamated trait

## Now we iteratively combine the matrices according to the dependencies above
M1 <- comb2matrices(bin_mats$`mental barbel`, bin_mats$`inner mental barbel`, dependent.state = 2) ## 'inner mental barbel' is dependent on column 2 of the first matrix ('mental barbel' matrix).
M[[newTraitName]] <- comb2matrices(M1, bin_mats$`outer mental barbel`, dependent.state = c(3,4)) ## `outer mental barbel` is dependent on columns 3 and 4 {10, 11} of M1 (i.e. a `mental barbel` is present, 'inner mental barbel' may or may not be present)
states <- colnames(M[[newTraitName]]) # Our new multistate characters in terms of the original three characters
names(states) <- 1:length(states) # With their numeric names

## Now we have to recode the data in our dataset to reflect our structured data and hidden state coding and new character states
td.comb <-recode_td(tdf, gtraits, states, hidden0=2:3) ## hidden0 indicates which traits have hidden states when they are absent. These are dependent states.
```


```{r}
## Now let's repeat it for all the other traits; 
############
## Urohyal##
############
g <- induced_subgraph(G1, which(con.comp$membership==7))
bin_mats <- init_binary_matrix(g)
gtraits <- names(bin_mats)
newTraitName <- paste(gtraits, collapse="+")

## Same structure as mental barbels
M1 <- comb2matrices(bin_mats[[1]], bin_mats[[2]], dependent.state = 2) 
M[[newTraitName]] <- comb2matrices(M1, bin_mats[[3]], dependent.state = c(3,4)) 
states <- colnames(M[[newTraitName]])
names(states) <- 1:length(states)

td.comb <-recode_td(td.comb, gtraits, states, hidden0=2:3) ## hidden0 indicates which traits have hidden states when they are absent. These are dependent states.
#################
## Pectoral fin##
#################
g <- induced_subgraph(G1, which(con.comp$membership==8))
mats <- get_graph_matrix(g)
bin_mats <- mats$binary.matrices[mats$nodes.sorted]
gtraits <- names(bin_mats)
newTraitName <- paste(gtraits, collapse="+")

## More complicated structure than the previous two, with more states (16)
M1 <- comb2matrices(bin_mats[[1]], bin_mats[[2]], dependent.state = 2) 
M2 <- comb2matrices(M1, bin_mats[[3]], dependent.state = 4) 
M[[newTraitName]] <- comb2matrices(M2, bin_mats[[4]], dependent.state = c(7,8)) 
 
states <- colnames(M[[newTraitName]])
names(states) <- 1:length(states)

td.comb <-recode_td(td.comb, gtraits, states, hidden0=2:length(gtraits)) ## hidden0 indicates which traits have hidden states when they are absent. These are dependent states.

###############
## Pelvic Fin##
###############
g <- induced_subgraph(G1, which(con.comp$membership==9))
mats <- get_graph_matrix(g)
bin_mats <- mats$binary.matrices[mats$nodes.sorted]
gtraits <- names(bin_mats)
newTraitName <- paste(gtraits, collapse="+")

## Same as first two
M1 <- comb2matrices(bin_mats[[1]], bin_mats[[2]], dependent.state = 2) 
M[[newTraitName]] <- comb2matrices(M1, bin_mats[[3]], dependent.state = c(3,4)) 
states <- colnames(M[[newTraitName]])
names(states) <- 1:length(states)

td.comb <-recode_td(td.comb, gtraits, states, hidden0=2:length(gtraits)) ## hidden0 indicates which traits have hidden states when they are absent. These are dependent states.


## Now we can move on to our non-connected traits. These are recoded only to deal with polymorphism and missing data. 
states <- setNames(c("0", "1"), 1:2)
td.comb <- recode_td(td.comb,"vomer", states)
td.comb <- recode_td(td.comb, "accessory vomerine tooth plate", states)
td.comb <- recode_td(td.comb, "anterior nasal barbel", states)
td.comb <- recode_td(td.comb, "posterior nasal barbel", states)
td.comb <- recode_td(td.comb, "maxillary barbel", states)


```

If the above code didn't work for you, you can catch up by loading this dataset from the `scate-shortcourse` package

```{r}
data(td.comb)
dir <- "../revbayes/" #Location to store revbayes scripts
dirD <- "../revbayes/data/" #Location to store data
dirW <- "../revbayes/Discr_maps/" #Location to store maps
dirR <- "../revbayes/output/" #Location to store output
```

We are going to reconstruct our stochastic character maps in RevBayes. In the workshop, we will do a Julia Child-style switch-a-roo and analyze completed analyses, rather than actually running these, because they will take too long. The following code makes a set of customized `.Rev` scripts and datasets that we can use to batch run our analyses. 


```{r eval=FALSE}
write.nexus(td.comb$phy, file="../revbayes/data/fishtree.tre") #This will be provided to you, but if you run your own analysis, you will want to put a tree in place that you can use in RevBayes

data(ParamoRevTemplate) # This reads in our template Rev file that we will modify

writeRevOntologyModels(td, M, dir, dirW, dirR, dirD)
```

Now we can run our analyses in RevBayes (We will not actually run these). 

```{r eval=FALSE}
setwd(dir)
# Load these packages if you have access to multiple cores and want to run in parallel
library(foreach) # Optional
library(doParallel) # Optional
registerDoParallel(cores=1) # Optional, if you are running on a server and have many cores!
res <- foreach(i=1:ncol(MT)) %dopar% {
  cmd <- paste("./rb07 ", colnames(MT)[i], ".Rev &", sep="") #./rb07 is Revbayes 1.07, which works well with this script. 
  #system(cmd) #Don't actually run!!
}
```

Our next step is to aggregate the traits by their trait types. This part is not quite done by the phenoscape API, so we're going to interact directly with the UBERON ontology. In the future, this will not be necessary. 


```{r}
# let's modify our character info to drop dependent states and match our new amalgamated characters
char_info_comb <- dropDependentTraits(char_info, dep.mat, td.comb)
data(UBERON)
BR_names <- c("dermatocranium", "paired fin", "external integument structure")
EF_names <- c("anatomical structure")

BR <- RAC_query(char_info_comb, UBERON, BR_names)
EF <- RAC_query(char_info_comb, UBERON, EF_names)
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
# This is a function to processes the maps produced by revbayes in a memory efficient manner and discretizes the maps to ease amalgamation
prepareMaps(td.comb, dirR, dirW)

#############
# Amalgamation at the BR level
#############

# we use the ouput `BR` from the RAC query obtained at Step 3. 
# This ouput contains character IDs for BR terms
# Let's rename those IDs to match the file names of the stochastic maps
cc <- BR
cc <-lapply(cc, function(x) gsub(" ", "_", x) )

# creating BR.maps to store the amalagamations
BR.maps<-vector("list", length(BR))
names(BR.maps)<-names(BR)

# run amalgamation using the renamed outputs from RAC query
# this loop construct one amalgamation for each BR term
# the number of amalgamations per term can be specified using `ntrees=`
for (i in 1:length(BR.maps))
{
  map<-paramo(cc[[i]], ntrees=2, dirW=dirW)
  BR.maps[[i]]<-map
}

#############
# Amalgamation at the EF level
#############
# we use the ouput `EF` from the RAC query obtained at Step 3. 
# This ouput contains character IDs for EF term
# Let's rename those IDs to match the file names of the stochastic maps
cc3 <- EF
cc3 <-lapply(cc3, function(x) gsub(" ", "_", x) )

# creating EF.maps to store the amalagamations
EF.maps<-vector("list", length(EF))
names(EF.maps)<-names(EF)

# run amalgamation using the renamed outputs from RAC query
# this code will return 1 amalgamated stochastic map of the EF character
for (i in 1:length(EF.maps))
{
  map<-paramo(cc3[[i]], ntrees=2, dirW=dirW)
  EF.maps[[i]]<-map
}
```

If you skipped the steps above, no problem, we can simply load the pre-cooked data. 

```{r}
data(EF.maps)
data(BR.maps)
```

Let's plot and view the results!
