# Phylogenetic Comparative Analysis of Integrated Anatomical Traits: A Short Course

This R package encapsulates the material for the short course on _Phylogenetic Comparative Analysis of Integrated Anatomical Traits_.

The purpose of doing so is to leverage the R package installation mechanism for ensuring that all R dependencies needed for the course are installed and available, simply as a result of installing this package.

The material itself is in the form of vignettes written in RMarkdown. Users are encouraged to modify the code chunks and re-execute the vignettes as a means of exploring the material.
