# Phylogenetic Comparative Analysis of Integrated Anatomical Traits: A Short Course

This R package encapsulates the material for the short course on _Phylogenetic Comparative Analysis of Integrated Anatomical Traits_.

The purpose of doing so is to leverage the R package installation mechanism for ensuring that all R dependencies needed for the course are installed and available, simply as a result of installing this package.

The material itself is in the form of vignettes written in RMarkdown. Users are encouraged to modify the code chunks and re-execute the vignettes as a means of exploring the material.

### Installation

You can download the course material to your computer directly from [Github](http://github.com/phenoscape/scate-shortcourse) as a Zip archive. Click the _Download Zip_ link that appears under the _Clone or Download_, move the Zip archive to a directory of your choice, then unpack it.

You can then open the folder containing the material as a project in RStudio, and render ("knit") and modify the vignette(s) (see `vignette/` subdirectory).

The RPhenoscape vignette depends only on the [RPhenoscape package](http://rphenoscape.phenoscape.org), which can be installed directly from Github as per its documentation. (RPhenoscape has itself a number of recursive dependencies; installing the package will install those, too.)

The PARAMO vignette has a number of dependencies. These can be installed automatically by installing the workshop package, either from the command line (use `R CMD build`, followed by `R CMD INSTALL`), or from within RStudio using the `install_github()` function in the `remotes` package (which can be installed from CRAN using `install.packages()`):

```r
remotes::install_github("phenoscape/scate-shortcourse")
```

Note that this will use the default options for build arguments, which will leave out building and installing the vignettes. Since the best use of the vignettes is to go through (and potentially modify) them within RStudio, this shouldn't be an issue.
